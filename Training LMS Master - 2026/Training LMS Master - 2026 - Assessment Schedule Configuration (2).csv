- StoreHub Features (All the cool things you’ll want to show off!)
- System Navigation (The map to guide you through the StoreHub world!)

Refer to the slides titled All-in-One.pptx as your guide. As you go through the slides, remember: If something seems confusing or raises questions, don’t just stare at the screen hoping it makes sense (trust me, it won’t!).

Use the Q&A sheet to jot down your questions for your trainer. We’re here to guide you, and we love answering questions—no question is too small..or stupid!",https://storehub.sg.larksuite.com/wiki/QqIDwLTciiUfhnk7dLylG5I6ghb,https://forms.gle/dAiBZXvPqpfg5fjK8,To test new hire's product knowledge,Trainee,End of Day

Onboarding Coordinator,Buddy Session,4,"Introducing the Buddy Session: Learning From the Pros 🤝

While self-study is a fantastic way to build your foundation, nothing beats the insight and guidance of a senior showing you their top skills in action.

Enter the Buddy Session—your opportunity to learn directly from seasoned experts. This is your chance to connect with the Onboarding Executives.

But it’s more than just a meet-and-greet! These sessions will help you:
- Get to know your senior teammates better.
- Understand their workflows.
- Learn how to communicate effectively as a team when handling merchants.

What’s Expected During the Sessions ✍️

1. Ask Questions: Come prepared with queries and ask away! Use this time to dig deep into their workflows and responsibilities.
2. Observe: Pay close attention to their processes and how they manage tasks.
3. Record Your Learnings: Create a copy of the Buddy Checklist Template to document everything you learn. This checklist will serve as a record for you and will be reviewed by your trainer.",https://storehub.sg.larksuite.com/sheets/ZqDlseFE3hfXObt78Sql4vq8gsc,-,-,-,
Onboarding Coordinator,Menu Setup,4,"Menu Setup Challenge: Channel Your Inner Onboarding Executive 🎯

The purpose of this task is to help you get hands-on experience with menu setup—just like an Onboarding Executive! Upskilling starts here. 💪

Below, you’ll find a table linking to real merchant tickets where they’ve sent their menus and requested item setups in their BackOffice.

Here’s what you need to do:
1. Open the Request section in each ticket and review the merchant’s menu.
2. Use your BackOffice account (the one you created on Day 1) to set up the items from these tickets.
3. Create at least 40 products each for both F&B and Retail businesses.
  - Example: From the F&B Intercom ticket, add 40 products.
  - From the Retail Intercom ticket, add another 40 products.

Once you're done, it’s time to show off your skills! Inform your Buddy to review your work by sharing access to your BackOffice. Don’t forget to add them as an employee to give them a peek at your setup.

Good luck—and may your menus be as smooth as your skills! 🍔🛍️","F&B: https://app.intercom.com/a/inbox/v2axofpf/inbox/conversation/189972000831621?view=List

Onboarding Coordinator,Hardware Assessment,3,"Time to roll up your sleeves and get technical with the Hardware Assessment! 💪
Here’s what you’ll need to do:
1. Assemble hardware devices
Put together the gadgets like a pro based on everything you’ve learned during training.
2. Troubleshoot like a champ
Your trainer will assign you a scenario- your job is to diagnose and resolve the issue.
