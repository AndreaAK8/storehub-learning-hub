- Situation, problem > did not deep dive, but giving merchant a scenario when merhcant already see the problem
- there's no understanding and listening of problem > jump into assuming the pain. 

2nd Spin: Messy - whatsapp selling online? 
- Mixed up online sales and whatsapp ssales. assume merchant doing online sales. 

the Spins are everywhere, forcing spin and information to assumptions on what he thinks merchant should fave. ",2,"- Showing alot of ""training setup"" instead of "" how to use system""",1,"Weak echo & summary.
- only summarise what was discussed, not finding out what merchant sees value in. 

pricing recommendation: 
- was also very messy and unsure.",3,"1. Good on calling out situations to deep dive reasonings. 
2. Negotiation can be better as there's no urgency creation done. 
"" the reason why i'm""PUSHING"" you ebcasue i can give a. discount"" > more of a conversation towards, possible to proceed today? as i can reduce the upfront cost, or give you a better price to save a little more.
3. Discount was given to vague .",

- Full SPIN done. 

2nd SPIN - Staff issue (manpower issue) 
- missing quantifier/ pain indicator. 

3rd SPIN- custoemr data 
- ok, but giving a scenario will be more impactful if it was relatable to client's situation. 

4th spin - returning customer - messy 
-jumping to unrelevant situation where  saving time to gather data when we talking about how we get return csutomer to come back",2,N/A,1,"Echo and summary : 
( not strong, not based on what the merchant want but based on what was discussed) 

Pricing :just a rough price, need to learn the full pricing. ",2,"1. Good in understanding the whole decision making process 
""What's the challenge for u to proceed today "" > good
2. handling price objections still needs to be improve. 
- negotiation is not always "" bosss"" to decide > which shows less confidence in u 
- negotiation starts off with understanding expectations vs comitments. not asked boss first only can get back whether can go with their epxectations. ",

pricing : 
- to be more familiar with advance vs starter",3,"- Good we try to find out the concern, dig deeper to find out why discuss, what to dicsuss what to compare.

- Good challenging on what's lacking, whats stopping them from making decision. 

1. Understand the  decision making process. 
- If today cant, what's the next best timeline.
