### **Quantified Bottlenecks & Pain Points for Automation Analysis**

1. **Manual Scorecard Management**  
* **Pain Point:** Creating and updating individual scorecards is highly time-consuming and prone to manual data entry errors. Each scorecard has a minimum of 4 tabs, increasing complexity.  
* **Manual Effort:**  
  * Andrea manually creates a new scorecard file for every new hire.  
  * After each assessment, Andrea must locate the correct hire's file, navigate to the correct tab, and type in the scores and feedback.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Setup Time:** **2-3 minutes** per new hire to create and format the scorecard.  
  * **Data Entry Time:** **5-10 minutes** per assessment to find the file, enter results, and add feedback for one person.  
  * **Total Time per Batch:** For a typical batch of 10 hires with 3-4 key evaluations each, this manual work accumulates to **3.5 to 4+ hours** of Andrea's time.  
2. **Repetitive Guidance & Follow-Up**  
* **Pain Point:** New hires with varying levels of proactivity frequently ask for information that has already been provided, requiring Andrea to stop higher-value work to repeat instructions.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea must personally and repeatedly direct learners to the location of training materials on the Lark Wiki and clarify instructions given during the briefing.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Time Cost:** This consumes up to **30 minutes** of Andrea's time per training batch, detracting from focused coaching and feedback.  
3. **Manual Inter-departmental Communication Relay**  
* **Pain Point:** The process to grant system access positions the trainer as a manual communication middleman, creating information lag and administrative overhead.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea acts as a human notification system. She sends the request, waits for a notification from Billing, and then must relay the confirmation back to each new hire.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Administrative Overhead:** This requires Andrea to perform a multi-step administrative task (send, wait, receive, relay) instead of focusing on training. It requires context-switching and introduces delay, as new hires cannot proceed until Andrea has relayed the final confirmation.  
4. **Inconsistent Briefing Delivery**  
* **Pain Point:** The high volume of information to be delivered in kick-off briefings makes it difficult to ensure consistency and clarity for every batch, leading to follow-up questions.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea relies on memory and personal notes to deliver critical instructions. Key details can be accidentally missed or phrased differently each time.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Risk:** High risk of inconsistent training experience. The direct impact is measured by the time spent on "Repetitive Guidance" (Bottleneck \#2), which is caused by initial communication gaps.

## **Process 2: Scheduling and Preparing for a New Training Batch**

### **Goal:** To prepare and schedule a comprehensive training calendar for a new batch of hires, covering the initial product training and coordinating subsequent role-specific sessions.

**Key Parameters:**

* **Frequency:** Weekly or Bi-weekly, aligned with hiring cycles.  
* **Average Batch Size:** 3-8 new hires.  
* **Complexity:** Involves coordinating schedules for 9 distinct roles across 3 different regions (MY, PH, TH).

**Process Trigger:** The process begins every Friday after the HR department updates the Master Training Calendar with a new list of hires, their roles, and start dates.  
---

### **A. Trainer's Manual Actions (Andrea)**

This process can be broken into two distinct phases: Scheduling/Coordination and Material Preparation.

#### **Phase 1: Scheduling & Coordination (Performed Weekly)**

1. **Monitors Master Calendar:** Checks the Master Training Calendar every Friday to identify all new hires for the upcoming week's batch.  
2. **Blocks Core Training Time:** Manually creates calendar blocks in her own schedule for the Day 1 & 2 Product Knowledge sessions.  
3. **Cross-References Schedules:** Manually compares the "Master Training Calendar" (from HR) against the "Master Training Schedule" (the overall template) to map out the full 5-day plan for the batch.  
4. **Creates Individual Calendar Events:** Manually generates numerous, separate Lark Calendar events based on the batch composition (e.g., "Day 1 Product Training," "Day 3 BC People Engagement," "Day 4 Care Hardware Assessment"). The number of events is directly proportional to the number of unique roles in the batch.  
5. **Coordinates with Coaches:**  
   1. Initiates Lark messages with coaches from various departments to confirm their availability for role-specific training sessions (e.g., review sessions, mock tests).  
   2. Gathers any special requests or adjustments needed for the schedule.  
6. **Blocks Coach & Trainee Time:** Manually creates and blocks calendar events that involve specific coaches and trainees from Day 3 onwards.  
7. **Dispatches Invitations:** Manually invites each specific new hire and the correct corresponding coach(es) to every single relevant calendar event, ensuring no one is missed or invited to the wrong session.

#### **Phase 2: Asset & Material Preparation (Performed per Batch/As Needed)**

1. **Duplicates Scorecard Templates:** Manually creates copies of the "Assessment Scorecard Template" for each unique role present in the new batch (e.g., 5 roles in a batch requires creating 5 separate scorecard files).  
2. **Shares Assets:** Manually shares the newly created scorecards with the relevant coaches before the training begins.  
3. **Reviews for Product Updates:** Manually monitors Lark Announcements and other channels for notifications about new product features or process changes.  
4. **Updates Training Slides:** When an update is found, manually opens the training presentation (.pptx file), incorporates the new information, adjusts the slide structure, and saves the new version.  
5. **Updates Wiki Documentation:** For role-specific process changes (e.g., a new sales pitching step), manually navigates to the correct Lark Wiki page and edits the content to reflect the update.

### **Quantified Bottlenecks & Pain Points for Automation Analysis**

**1\. Manual Scheduling Overhead**

* **Pain Point:** The end-to-end process of scheduling for a single batch is a significant, recurring time drain that requires deep, uninterrupted focus.  
* **Manual Effort:** Involves cross-referencing multiple sources, manually creating dozens of calendar events, and individually inviting participants.  
* **Quantified Impact:** This entire process consumes **2 to 5 hours of manual work** per batch, depending on the size and complexity of the roles involved.

**2\. High Risk of Coordination Errors**

* **Pain Point:** Manually dispatching a high volume of individualized calendar invites is extremely prone to human error.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea must meticulously check that the correct trainees and coaches are invited to the correct events.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Error Rate:** Coordination errors, such as missed invitations, occur approximately **twice a month** and often require a coach to proactively follow up with Andrea.  
  * **Consequence:** This degrades the professionalism of the training experience and can cause session delays or require last-minute scrambling.

**3\. Brittle & Reactive Scheduling**

* **Pain Point:** The manually created schedule is rigid and difficult to change. A single alteration creates a cascade of manual work.  
* **Manual Effort:** If a coach is unavailable or a new hire's start date changes, Andrea must manually review the entire calendar, de-conflict sessions, and reschedule all dependent events and participants one by one.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Frequency & Rework Time:** This type of reactive adjustment occurs **2-3 times per month**, with each change requiring **15-25 minutes of manual rescheduling effort *per affected role*.** A single change impacting three roles can consume over an hour of rework.  
  * **Project Impact:** This reactive fire-fighting disrupts planned work on other BAU and project tasks, leading to delays.

**4\. Reactive & Manual Content Management**

* **Pain Point:** Keeping training materials (Slides and Wiki) current is a reactive, manual, and disconnected process that requires both administrative and creative effort.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea must constantly monitor announcement channels, then manually edit multiple documents. This involves not just adding text, but also adding pictures, ensuring formatting looks good, and using creative skills to beautify slides.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Time Cost:** Each major content update cycle consumes **2-3 hours** of this focused creative and administrative work.  
  * **Risk:** High risk of delivering outdated information to new hires if an update is missed, undermining the training's effectiveness.

**5\. Regional Resource Constraints**

* **Pain Point:** The availability of coaches is limited, especially across different regions, leading to frequent scheduling conflicts that the manual process cannot easily resolve.  
* **Manual Effort:** When a designated coach is unavailable, Andrea must manually re-initiate the coordination process: message other potential coaches, negotiate new times, and then execute the full manual rescheduling (as described in Bottleneck \#3).  
* **Quantified Impact:** This is a primary driver of "Scheduling Chaos," frequently leading to training extensions and a poor experience for new hires who have their schedules constantly shifted.

## **Process 3: Post-Training Finalization**

### **Goal:** To accurately consolidate new hire assessment scores, calculate a final Training Performance Score based on complex, role-specific assessment models (weighted 80% learning, 20% participation), and gather feedback for program improvement.

**Key Parameters:**

* **Frequency:** Event-driven; occurs each time a new hire completes their training program.  
* **Scope:** 3-8 new hires per batch, on average.

**Process Trigger:** A new hire completes their final scheduled training day or assessment.  
---

### **A. Trainer's Manual Actions (Andrea)**

This process consists of two main phases: finalizing performance records and collecting post-training feedback.

#### **Phase 1: Performance Record Finalization & Communication (Per Hire/Batch)**

1. **Retrieves Individual Records:** Manually locates and opens the individual Assessment Scorecard file for each graduating new hire.  
2. **Audits for Completion:** Manually reviews scorecards to ensure coaches have filled them out. If data is missing or an assessment was skipped, Andrea must pause her work to manually message the coach, chase for the missing scores, and await their update.  
3. **Aggregates Scores for Final Calculation:**  
   1. Manually locates and transcribes the raw scores for every weighted assessment (e.g., up to 10 different scores for a Business Consultant) from the individual scorecard into the "Master Training Performance Record."  
   2. Relies on pre-set formulas in the Master Record to calculate the final weighted score based on the transcribed data. The complexity lies in ensuring the many individual scores are transcribed correctly for the formula to work.  
4. **Composes Performance Summaries:** Manually writes a qualitative summary of each new hire's performance, highlights, and lowlights in a "comment box" field within the master record.  
5. **Dispatches Coach Updates:** Manually composes and sends a Lark message to the respective coach for each new hire, summarizing the key performance points from the comment box.

#### **Phase 2: Feedback Collection & Analysis (Weekly Cycle)**

1. **Distributes Survey:** On the Monday following a training completion, manually sends a Lark Survey form to all recent graduates.  
2. **Manages Compliance:** Manually checks the number of survey submissions and sends one mass reminder via Lark to encourage completion by the specified deadline.  
3. **Analyzes Qualitative Feedback:** Manually reads through all comments and feedback submitted in the Lark Survey.  
4. **Formulates Action Plans:** Based on the manual review, personally conceptualizes and decides on potential improvement areas, action plans, or "alarming signs" to watch for in the training program.

### **Quantified Bottlenecks & Pain Points for Automation Analysis**

**1\. Manual Data Consolidation & Reporting**

* **Pain Point:** The entire process of closing out a batch is a significant, repetitive time sink involving data chasing, transcription, and manual communication.  
* **Manual Effort:** Involves auditing coach submissions, chasing for missing data, copying/pasting numerous data points across various tabs, writing individual summaries, and composing separate update messages.  
* **Quantified Impact:** This end-to-end process consumes **2 to 5 hours of focused manual work** per batch, depending on its size and the completeness of the source data.

**2\. High Risk of Data Integrity Errors**

* **Pain Point:** Data integrity is compromised by both manual transcription errors and incomplete source data from coach scorecards, making final reports unreliable.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea must not only transcribe up to 10 different scores per hire without error but also act as an auditor, chasing coaches for missing data. The complexity of different weighting models for each role increases the cognitive load and chance of error.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Discovery & Rework:** Errors are typically discovered reactively, only **when a coach questions the data**. This triggers a time-consuming manual process of retrieving the original scorecard to diagnose the error, chasing the coach if needed, and correcting the master records.

**3\. Lack of Automated Analytics & Insight Generation**

* **Pain Point:** The current process does not automatically generate insights or measure the success of the training program. The burden of analysis falls entirely on the trainer.  
* **Manual Effort:** Andrea must manually read all qualitative feedback and attempt to spot trends, connect them to performance data, and formulate action plans from scratch.  
* **Quantified Impact:**  
  * **Subjective Analysis:** Improvement plans are based on Andrea's personal interpretation rather than objective, data-driven insights, which can be inconsistent and difficult to justify.  
  * **"Invisible Impact":** Without a proper reporting system, it is difficult to measure or demonstrate the value and ROI of the training program to leadership, making its success feel intangible.
